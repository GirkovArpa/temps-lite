## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Download the [Quark](https://quark.sciter.com/) executable corresponding to your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/GirkovArpa/temps-lite/releases).  If it's not available, simply run the appropriate Sciter binary inside this folder.  They can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk) under `bin.lnx`, `bin.osx`, or `bin.win`.

For example, on Windows, you could download [scapp.exe](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/blob/master/bin.win/x32/scapp.exe), place it in this folder, and double-click it.  That's all there is to it!

On Linux, the process is similar.  Simply run [scapp](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/blob/master/bin.lnx/x64/scapp) inside this folder, if your operating system is 64-bit.

## Bugs üêõ

  To resolve this issue, please install the fonts [Rubik Regular 400](assets/fonts/Rubik\ Regular\ 400.ttf) & [Rubik Bold 700](assets/fonts/Rubik\ Bold\ 700.ttf) manually, then delete (or comment-out) line `6` from [main.htm](main.htm):

## History üìú

This application was forked from the original [temps](https://github.com/jackd248/temps) repository.  Unlike that project, this one is based on [Sciter](https://sciter.com/) instead of Electron.

The weather icons are made by the [original author](https://github.com/jackd248). If you would like to use them in your own project, you can find the icons on [Github](https://github.com/jackd248/weather-iconic) or at the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/konradmichalik/collection/weather/).
