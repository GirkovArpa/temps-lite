## Credits

This application was forked from the original [temps](https://github.com/jackd248/temps) repository.  Unlike that project, this one is based on [Sciter](https://sciter.com/) instead of Electron.

The weather icons are made by the [original author](https://github.com/jackd248). If you would like to use them in your own project, you can find the icons on [Github](https://github.com/jackd248/weather-iconic) or at the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/konradmichalik/collection/weather/).
