## Building ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Compiling with Rust is fairly straightforward:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
When running, the folder [locale](locale) must be in the same folder as the executable, and the [Sciter](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/) library from either `bin.win`, `bin.lnx`, or `bin.osx` must be in the folder as well, or in your `PATH`.

## Location

Normally it is very straightforward to enter your location into the settings window in temps-lite: just type TOWN, COUNTRY and click "Apply". But what, if you live in a place, the name of which exists several times in your own country? The solution: Go to [OpenweatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/find?q=#) for example and enter the name of your city. In the case of multiple search results for your country you will see the geocoorcinates for the individual search results with their names. Right-click on the desired one and select 'Copy link address' from the menu. Paste it into the settings window of temps-lite. Delete everything from the insertion except for the numbers separated either by a comma or a space and click 'Apply'. You should now see the weather in your location.

Even more granular: The weather above your home! Go for example to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/51.330/10.453) and enter your home address. The map of your location will appear. Look for your house/apartment and right-click on it. Select 'Show address' from the menu. You will see the geocoordinates of it on the left side of the window. Copy them and paste them into the settings window of temps-lite. Delete everything from the insertion except for the numbers separated by either a comma or a space. Click 'Apply', and that's it!

## History üìú

This application was forked from the original [temps](https://github.com/jackd248/temps) repository.  Unlike that project, this one is based on [Sciter](https://sciter.com/) instead of Electron.

The weather icons are made by the [original author](https://github.com/jackd248). If you would like to use them in your own project, you can find the icons on [Github](https://github.com/jackd248/weather-iconic) or at the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/konradmichalik/collection/weather/).
